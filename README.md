This is an embedded database system which is used to learn OS, Database and Compiler Principle by Walker.
Maybe this is a long-term project because of Walker's terrible coding ability and limited time.
Thanks for your guidance but don't laugh at me about Walker's slow coding speed. hah hah hah.

Of course, the code is all about OS, not database, because I want to make my database all in just one file, like sqlite.
