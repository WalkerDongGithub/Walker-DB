This is an embedded database system which is used to learn OS, Database and Compiler Principle by Walker.
Maybe this is a long-term project because of Walker's terrible coding ability and limited time.
Thanks for your guidance but don't laugh at me about Walker's slow coding speed. hah hah hah.

Upload my project first, with the base implementation of the Unix syscall interface encapsulation and the base manager of the file on disk.
Of course, the code is all about OS, not database, because I want to make my database all in just one file, like sqlite.

Upload the LRU Algorithm, which implements the base function of the LRU page replacement algorithm and passes the basis test.
Hope that it doesn't have any bug.
